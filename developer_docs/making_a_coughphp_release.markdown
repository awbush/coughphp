Making a CoughPHP Release
=========================

Use the `make_release` script.  For example, if the path is `/path/to/coughphp-trunk/` then run:

	cd /path/to/coughphp-trunk/scripts/
	./make_release ../ ../../coughphp-1.1

If you only want the zip file then you can delete the directory that is created:

	rm -rf ../../coughphp-1.1
